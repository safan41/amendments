  <p>Many disputes came about as the civil war raged on in between the North ans South, one being the use of slaves. Documents such as Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclomation couldn't do enough to prevent slavery at the time. As the Civil War came to an end, the one major step towards slavery was agreed in congress. The Thirtheenth amendment prohibits the use of slavery unless punished for a federal crime to which convicted. This does not mean that a work organization can force you to work without pay, as that would seem to most that it would violate the Thirteenth Amendment for involuntary and forced labor for no justified reason.</p>
