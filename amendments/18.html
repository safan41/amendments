  <p>The Eighteenth amendment was immensly seen as an expirement to many, as its effect only lasted for 14 years due to the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment. The Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the "manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors", which originally seemed like a great idea at first. The fatal flaw that led this to be repealed was a wave of anger, crime, and hiding liquor, making Congress feel that this Amendment is bringing more problems than it should've prevented.</p>
