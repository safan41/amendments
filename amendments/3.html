  <p>The Third Amendment prevents soldiers to stay under private houses as long as the owner or law permits them. The need for this was really to go against the British Quartering Act which enforced soldier to be able to stay in private homes without consent of owner. Nowadays, the importance of this amendment isn't to great, but it shows regulation that was needed when the country was created.</p>
