  <p>Before the radification of the XXII Amendment, presidential terms were not predtermined. This actually meant that a person could get reelected to president an infinite ammount of times. The Twenty-Second Amendment puts a two-term limit on the times people can get elected president. Some of the influence for this decision came from Franklin D. Roosevelt's election being four terms. </p>
