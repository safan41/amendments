  <p>With the usage of electors in a state-wide vote, many of the results would be considerably inaccurate since it is a state-wide vote and not a vote for a President. The Seventeeth Amendment establishes voter election of popular vote (direct vote) to elect a Senator to office rather than electoral college. People in support of the idea found this necessary because they would say that it would allow people to represent themselves in voting for a new Senator than having to influence a state legislator to vote. If for some reason a Senator is unable to fulfill their duties, state legislators can then appoint a temporary Senator.</p>
