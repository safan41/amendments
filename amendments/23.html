  <p>Since Congress control many parts of D.C., they found it originally unecessary to let D.C. vote. The Twenty-Third amendment would allow poeple in the District of Columbia to vote by having the district to act as a state, which would get them get electors that are not "more than the least populous state". Congress has seemed to have ratified this amendment fairly quickly due to its support.</p>
