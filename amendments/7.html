  <p>The Seventh Amendment would guarantee Americans to have the right to trial with a jury with any case involving greater than twenty dollars. Americans have the right to choose to have a jury of our peers or have just a judge to decide the case. One recurring problem with this ammendment was what the definition of "common law" would be, leaving people to have to assume what the proposers ment by this and what would be violating the Seventh Amendment.</p>
