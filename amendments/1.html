  <p>When the Constitution came into effect, one thing was clear: the constitution didn't say what we could nor couldn't do. The First Amendment was part of the Bill of Rights to lay out the five basic rights (freedoms) that all American citizens are guaranteed: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Freedom of Speech<ul>
    <li><small>Unless it contains real threats, "fighting words" (words that could cause an intense fight), or defamation (false statements that can heavily damage a person's reputation that could end up in a legal case, espicially with the defendant knowing they lied).</small></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Freedom of Religion</li>
  <li>Freedom of the Press<ul>
    <li><small>Unless it contains any of the restrictions from Freedom of Speech, obscene sexual content, and sexual child abuse</small></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Freedom of Assembly<ul>
    <li><small>Being able to gather together in one group</small></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Freedom to Petition<ul>
    <li><small>Being able to ask the government to change laws</small></li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h6>Freedom of Religion</h6>
  <p>To have Freedom of Religion, government can not have any influence of any practice of religion. It protects a person's freedom to worship from other group (e.g. schools, police departments).</p>
  <h6>Freedom of Speech/Press</h6>
  <p>To have Freedom of Speech, government can not prohibit any use of speech, unless given the circumstances of direct abusiveness or threats. Freedom of the Press being a simillar circumstance, it can not prohibit nor censor any publicaiton unless it is obscene. Both protect the rights of people to say whatever they can and express themselves without government having restrictions on what you can express. This even includes vulgar and "hate speech" (to a certain level).</p>
  <h6>Freedom of Assembly/Petition</h6>
  <p>To have the Freedom of Assembly, government guarantees the right to be able to gather in a group, and Freedom to Petition would have the government guarantee that people can ask the government to change things by gathering people's support for permission.</p>
