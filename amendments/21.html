  <p>Seeing people ignoring the purpose of the Eighteenth Amendment and to see increased problems is what caused Congress to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment. The crime rate was much higher than Congress thought it would be if enacted. The main cause of this was simply people's love with liquor, and feel restricted if the right to have liquor is gone from them. People started to secretly sell liquor, which eventually led to to more and more government disapprovement.</p>
