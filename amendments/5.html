  </div>
  <p>The Fifth Amendment gives citizens some basic legal protection. They include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>You cannot be convicted of a serious crime without the indictment of a grand jury.</li>
  <li>You cannot be tried for the same crime more than twice.<ul>
    <li>This means if convicted, found innocent, and more evidence flows in, there still cannot be another trial.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You are protected from having to witness against yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  Two other things were mentioned in the amendment, due process and takings.
  <h3>Due Process</h3>
  <p>Due process simply says that the government must act in recongnition of the legal rules and cannot go against them. This protects people from losing their life, liberty, or even propety without going through the whole legal process.</p>
  <h3>Takings</h3>
  <p>The takings clause of this amendment was the phrase "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." This has many understandings to go towards the common idea that the government cannot take private property unless it is aquired for "public use" and if the government pays back "just compensation [money]".</p>
