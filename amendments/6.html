  <p><i>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.</i></p>

  <p>Amendment Six establishes rights of criminal defendants.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The defendant has the right for a lawyer, even if they can't afford one.</li>
  <li>The defendant has the right to be in court (their district one).</li>
  <li>The defandant must have a jury with state requirements (typically twelve is state minimum)</li>
  </ul>
  As well as these terms, the amendment will ensure no delays that don't need to be taken will not be taken, to make it a speedy, fair trial.
