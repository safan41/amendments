  <p>At the time the Bill of Rights passed, the British despised of Americans, leaving congress to decide that a "well regulated militia" is necessary to leave the United States a free country. With the need of a militia seen less necessary now, the second part leaves out with debate. It guaruntees the inclusion of people able to posess arms. The wording of the Second Amendment leaves citizens with that mentality, yet some are speculating of what people define as the Second Amendment. Currently, many gun deaths are leading people to fire back at the Second Amendment, while as defence says they support the Amendment. More and more debate has rose over what would be violating the Second Amendment.</p>
